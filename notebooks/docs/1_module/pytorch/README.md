**This folder is some experiences about pytorch.**

**Nomenclature:**
- s is for single
- m is for multi


- in is for input
- out is for output

**Example**: sin-sout = single input, single output

Using numbers to order folders and notebooks.

In this case, intput and output are time series. For example,
a multiple input could be 3 times series. It gives no information about the 
number of samples taken for each time series.
